## Operational review workspace

This release adds an authenticated, structured batch workspace at `/operations.html`, backed by project-specific deterministic calculations, explicit validation, explainable decisions, and CSV/JSON exports. Decimal values are preserved exactly; no external model call is made.

Results are **read-only decision support**, not approvals or posted transactions. The feature does not send payments, sign contracts, destroy records, or control devices, and does not certify the whole application for production. See [the calculation contract and API guide](docs/OPERATIONS-REVIEW.md).

# ZhuaTech AI Production Scheduling

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for manufacturing planning, execution, quality, and traceability.

ZhuaTech AI Production Scheduling provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for manufacturing planning, execution, quality, and traceability. It is designed for manufacturing planners, production teams, quality teams, and plant managers, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise ai production scheduling, self-hosted ai production scheduling, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Enterprise Use

- **Primary users:** Manufacturing planners, production teams, quality teams, and plant managers.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Core Capabilities

- **Master data and production records** — Manage master data and production records with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Planning and execution workflows** — Coordinate planning and execution workflows through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Quality gates and exception handling** — Track quality gates and exception handling metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Equipment or process traceability** — Preserve equipment or process traceability evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Operational dashboards and alerts** — Expose operational dashboards and alerts in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Controlled approvals and audit evidence** — Connect controlled approvals and audit evidence to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Architecture and Runtime

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- AI-related features must retain human review, provider configuration, traceability, and safe fallback behavior.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
